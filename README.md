# Twitter Data Streaming using specific keywords
Text mining is the application of natural language processing techniques and analytical methods to text data in order to derive relevant information. Text mining is getting a lot attention these last years, due to an exponential increase in digital text data from web pages, google's projects such as google books and google ngram, and social media services such as Twitter. Twitter data constitutes a rich source that can be used for capturing information about any topic imaginable. This data can be used in different use cases such as finding trends related to a specific keyword, measuring brand sentiment, and gathering feedback about new products and services.
In this code I have used the Twitter Streaming API to display the recreactional trends followed by people across the world.
